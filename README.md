# VXLverse

VXLverse is like a toy box for building your own 3D video games. Imagine you're playing with your favorite toy set, placing characters around, and creating fun stories with them. That's exactly what VXLverse does, but in a digital world.

## Key Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Interface:** At the heart of VXLverse is an intuitive interface that allows for the placement and manipulation of 3D objects within the scene, akin to interactive digital architecture. This interface makes scene construction as simple as clicking and dragging objects into place.

- **Customizable Asset Library:** VXLverse provides a comprehensive library of 3D assets, including customizable meshes, materials, and textures. These assets can be tailored to your specifications, offering vast creative flexibility when designing your scenes.

- **Transformation Tools:** VXLverse features built-in tools for object transformation. These allow for the scaling, rotation, and relocation of objects, facilitating precise control over scene composition.

- **Import and Export Functionality:** Collaborative design and sharing are made easy with VXLverse. The platform supports the export and import of 3D scene files, enabling seamless cooperation between users and facilitating the distribution of your creations.

- **Quest Creation & NPCs:** Beyond environmental design, VXLverse integrates narrative elements with its quest creation feature. This allows users to breathe life into their 3D scenes, incorporating Non-Player Characters (NPCs) and crafting engaging storylines complete with dialogues and tasks.
